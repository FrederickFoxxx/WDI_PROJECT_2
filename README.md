Places and Spaces is a application that enables users to share experiences of music that they associate to a particular place. From famous recording studios, to gig venues to your friend’s garage. 


Places and Spaces is a fully authenticated MVC RESTful resource build using a MEN stack with referenced and embedded models. I used external APIs from google and youtube to enable the users’ to create and share musical memories.
